In a stock analysis project, data was sourced from S3 buckets and processed using Databricks for efficient transformation. The goal was to calculate the average opening price of various stocks. Both DataFrame and RDD approaches were utilized to handle the large-scale data, demonstrating flexibility in data processing. The transformed data, including the calculated average stock opening prices, was then stored back into S3 buckets, ensuring scalability and performance in the analysis workflow.
